# Story: IoT Generic Farm

### Farmer: Richi, Chri

With the continuous increase in world’s population, demand for food supply is extremely raised. That’s why Richi and Chri, wanted to become farmers. They want to help supply food to the world.
 
Both farmers start their day at 5 a.m. Chri starts his day with a nice cup of coffee, Richi prefers a fresh apple as breakfast. While the farmers are enjoying their breakfast, they can already check the status of their crops on their phones because every sensor in their glass house is connected with a web server which is running on a Raspberry Pi. On the phone they have an app which visualizes the data supplied by the sensors. This way they have all the important data of their plants with them all the time. Moreover, if any sensor drops below/above a certain threshold, they receive a push notification. The push notification includes the sensor id and the value of the sensor as well as the value range it should be in. This way they can immediately fix the problem with their plants. 

After their morning routine they start heading to the farm. The farm consists of a small glass house in which the plants grow. The glass house has multiple light sources and sensors in order to ensure perfect lighting for the plants all day round. Additionally, all the plants are connected to an automated water pumping station, which is connected to moisture sensors in the soil, and helps to regulate the perfect amount of water for the plants. Furthermore, an air conditioning system in combination with a humidity and temperature sensor make sure that there is always the best environment for the plants.

Additionally to the app, Richi and Chri, have set up terminal at the farm. The terminal monitors and controls all sensors, valves and much more. The terminal informs the farmers that the crops are not properly hydrated, so they start looking for the problem. Richi goes to the automated water pumping station and inspects all tubes if they are connected correctly and for any other malfunction. Chri in the meanwhile monitors every step through the terminal. If something in the system changes, he is going to notice it. With their combined efforts, the farmers find the flaw in the system and fix it immediately. Now the terminal shows no more problems and the plants can grow to their full potential.
